  ### Concept of the Project 
 
In India, crimes against women pose serious dangers to society's safety, justice, and gender equality. 
Domestic violence, sexual harassment, rape, dowry-related violence, and human trafficking are 
examples of crimes that not only cause immense agony to victims, but also build a culture of fear and 
unfairness that erodes society's fabric. Addressing this pervasive issue is critical to reaching 
Sustainable Development Goal 5 (SDG 5), which targets gender equality and the empowerment of all 
women and girls. Achieving this goal is not just important for social justice; it is also crucial for the 
country's overall development and progress. 
The goal of this project is to undertake a comprehensive study of crime data to better understand the 
patterns, trends, and consequences of crimes against women at the national level. The project aims 
to generate a complete and accurate image of the present situation of crimes against women by 
methodically evaluating data from numerous sources, including the National Crime Records Bureau 
(NCRB), government publications, academic studies, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). 
This research will assist in identifying the most frequent types of crimes, their geographical 
distribution, and the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics that lead to greater crime rates 
in specific places.
